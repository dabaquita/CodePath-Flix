### Notes
Really fun part of this project was learning more about navigation and the different types of ways to arrange data like the new collection view. Overall, I really liked solidifying my knowledge on those aspects and better ways to program efficiently and effectively.

### Notes
For this first part of the app, I decided to approach it entirely programmatically with no storyboards (except for the launch screen). This presented a few challenges such as getting the constraints correctly and also setting up the environment to support it. Overall, this was a really fun and great experience starting an app from scratch programmatically.
